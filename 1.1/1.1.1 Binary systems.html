			You already know the denary number system (although you might not have known what it is called). Denary is the number system we use in our everyday lives and has ten numerals: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Because it has ten numerals we call it base-10. When writing larger numbers needing more than one numeral each numeral is worth ten times the numeral to its right. In computing we also use the hexadecimal and binary number systems.<br><br>In binary we have only two digits 0 and 1 so we call this base-2. Computers as we know them today are electronic machines which at their most basic level are simply a collection of billions and billions of switches which can be either on (represented by the digit 1) and off (represented by the digit 0). For Humans to be able to work with computers we need ways of representing all of the data we use in binary. Everything you see on your computer screen can be converted in to binary so that it can be processed by the computer. In this section you will learn how all numbers, text, pictures, videos and sounds can be represented in binary.
			<h2>Denary numbers in binary:</h2>
			In denary if we want to use numbers bigger than 9 we have to start using multiple numerals. Each numeral is worth ten-times the numeral to its right. The number three-thousand, one-hundred and forty is shown in denary in figure 1 below.<br>

			This works in a very similar way with binary except that each numeral is worth only two-times the numeral to its right. Here we can see how the number forty would be represented in binary. This is because there are two states 1 and 0 hence the headings are of the powers of 2 starting with 2^0.<br>

			<h2>Converting</h2>
			You can convert to and from binary using the following techniques:
			<h3>Binary to Denary</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Write out the binary number.</li>
				<li>Write the denary number 1 above the least significant bit (the last digit on the right).</li>
				<li>Write the number 2 above the next most significant bit, then 4 and so on.</li>
				<li>Add together the denary values of all digits given as a 1. Ignore any 0s.</li>
			</ol>
